# Overview

I created the traditional two player version of Tic Tac Toe that can be played within the console. It takes alternating inputs between two players, and detects then the game has reached the end. This project uses traditional C# datastructures, and encorporates, logic, expressions, loops, structs, unions, user input, etc.

The hope with this application is that those who play it will have fun, and have a broader appreciation for the simplicity that comes from programming in object oriented languages.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the Student Version of Rider. It is a IDE that builds C# solutions. Additionally, it has great support for Mac, and other operating systems, especially those that are not windows.

I created this application in C# 11.0 while experimenting with ASP.NET Core 7.0.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add a play again feature
- Since most people don't play just one round of Tic Tac Toe, add a scoring system between players.
- Create a better visual representation of the tic tac Toe board (clean up, PrintBoard())
